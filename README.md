Voice recognition it's a Single Page Application **(SPA)** that helps type whatever you tell it. Also offers the possibility to listen to what you said:

You can see the live demo [here](https://corozb.github.io/voice-recognition/)

The design is minimalist just it uses two colors and four buttons:

To build it I used the [SpeechReconigtion Library](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Uso_de_la_Web_Speech_API) this library works through **events** by the moment just it's compatible with **Google Chrome**

To run locally you download the files and:
- npm install
- npm start

In the browser the url is:
- http://localhost:3000
